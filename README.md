# video_merge

I have uploaded the html, js & a png file. The js file is internally linked with html file as the js is a video.js which helps to merge 2 videos and let them play one after one like an youtube ad.
So the process to run is, download the files which are uploaded and store them in a seperate folder. Open the HTML file for the final output.
